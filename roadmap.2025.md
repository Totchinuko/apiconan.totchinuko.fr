# 2025 Roadmap

## Tot ! Custom

### Puppeteer Mode (Done)

Having the ability to design your own pose with a rotation tool that would be the very same use for accessories, only here for bones. Most bones of the body would be available to rotate, save for the facial one. Facial will simply have a bunch of premade emotes, with the ability to blend.

Rotation will be able to be applied on the currently played emote OR on a complete or partial T-Pose. I'll also provide simple breathing additive animation to bring more life to a static pose, and perhaps some simple head movement.

Puppeteer mode is meant to be quick to use, click the shortcut, move a few bones, close. You should be able to save poses, either complete or partial. Partial poses would be additive, meaning you could in theory apply a partial pose of the left arm, then one of the right arm, in order to produce a pose that offset both arms.

Having the possibility to equip a handful of accessories with the pose to be equipement automatically when the pose is applied. Think books, cups, and other object that would serve the purpose of the pose.

### Photo Mode

A free camera (with limited range to prevent abuse) that offer similar capabilities to Ansel. Look around, tilt, change the FOV. Some added effect as well such as black bar or Depth of Field.

It would also offer control over the environement, to change time of the day during photo mode, or the lighting/fog.

## Tot ! Admin

### Quest System Rework

Left unsatisfied with the way the current Quest System function, their will be a complete rework to provide procedural quest creation. This would allow to create quest from scratch directly from scripting. No promises that the old data will remain, but ideally I'd like to keep the old system to work on top of the new if possible.

### Environment Control (Done)

Possibility to control lighting of a scene. Sun intensity, fog, eclipse, moon color, sky color, etc... All through the scripting system in order to offer either map wide changes or local one in an area. Want to make a cavern dark ? You can do it.

### 1.0

This year I'd like to reach 1.0 for !Admin, meaning having it polished enough to not have major bugs in it if possible, and have its main feature set mostly done that it won't need a complete rework in the future.

## Tot ! Sudo

### World Map API

Predefined function to add widgets/markers to the in game map, with a priority system so mods can have a common place to add their content. This would then be reused by mods like Tot ! HUD for its minimap to include the same informations without the need of additional work.

### Nameplate API

Release of the nameplate API so that other mods can add widgets to the Sudo nameplate, just like RPR does.

## Other

### Tot ! Fishing 1.0

At least have a testing version of the mod. So main fishing mechanic, at least part of the content and its NPC. I plan to test the mod on the test server I plan to have, that will be opened to selected members of the Discord server.

### Environment Upgrade (Done)

Graphical upgrade of Exile Land with better lighting/fog and color grading.

### Trebuchet

A launcher for the game I've been working on for a while, capable of handling dedicated server launch but also the game client. Modlist management both from normal and test live workshop, multiple save profile, automated setting such as removing intro videos, background sound, and some performance sliders. An internal update system for mods to download what you want, when you want it.  
All of that in a clear and performant application.

## Live Questions

### Custom Texture Merger When ?
Perhaps not this year. Still planned, but given the nature of the beast, it is still unknown if it can be achieved to begin with. I prefer to focus on things I know I can do.
### Any Baits for Fishing ?
Yes, no list for now. They would be use to favor the capture of specific fishes.
### Fish will spawn for everyone or just yourself ?
3D fishes will spawn only for you, they are decorative regardless, part of the minigame.
### Do you plan to add dungeon stuff like traps ?
Yes, for admin. Launchers for example, but buttons and perhaps even particle effects.
### Any plans to update the play music node to support stuff like track tracking, next track, previous track, etc...
Not the scripting. I plan to have an Admin tool that takes care of that.
### Can we 'lock' bones during walking? E.g. arms behind the back? (Puppeteer)
Probably yes.
### Would you be able to make the cancel pose when attacking able to be disabled by admins? 
Maybe. Yes if possible.
### Are you planning to add nods to scripting system where you can edit items ?
Already on the todo list
### Possibility to apply custom sets to players using a script?
I'm not sure I want that yet. For now, I'm going to say no.
